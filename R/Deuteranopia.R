#' Red-green color blindness data
#'
#' Deuteranopia is a form of red-green color blindness due to the fact that medium wavelength sensitive cones (green) are missing. A deuteranope can only distinguish 2 to 3 different hues, whereas somebody with normal vision sees 7 different hues. A survey for this type of color blindness in human subjects produced a two-way table crossing color blindness and sex.
